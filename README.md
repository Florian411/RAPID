RAPID
=====
Read Alignment and Analysis Pipeline
------------------------------------

RAPID is a set of tools for the alignment, and analysis of genomic regions with small RNA clusters derived from small RNA sequencing data.
It currently features:
- a module for individual dataset analysis and investigation using automated plots in R (rapid_main)
- a comparative module (rapid_compare) that can take as input several datasets processed with rapid_main. It normalizes read counts and produces a battery of comparative visualizations of the different datasets provided.
